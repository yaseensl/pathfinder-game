# CSC317-JavaScript-Game

Ensure you have a header with your **Name**, **Student ID number**, and **GitHub URL** in each source file!

This is an **individual assignment**. This assignment must be written in **JavaScript** running in a **web browser page** using the HTML `<canvas>` tag for rendering.  
There are no specific requirements for the type or style of game, other than:
- It must be **your own original work**.
- It must **not** be one of the banned games listed below.
- It should show **a minimum level of effort and design** beyond trivial examples.

Your game may be **single-player**, **multi-player**, or even **zero-player** (such as a simulation).  

See W3Schools’ tutorials for help getting started:  
- [HTML Canvas Graphics](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp)  
- [HTML Canvas Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_canvas.asp)  
- [HTML Game Example](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp)  

Do **not** use any JavaScript frameworks, engines, or stacks — write all code yourself. If you want to use GenAI on this project, see the "Using Generative AI Responsibly" section below.  

> ⚠️ **VERY IMPORTANT:** Do **not** use `alert()` in the default game state.

When finished, submit your code to your GitHub repository with all files required to run your game and include a **write-up** following our standard template.  
Your write-up should:
- Describe your game, rules, and how to play.
- Explain any issues you encountered and how you resolved them.  
Submit this write-up to **Canvas** as usual, in addition to your GitHub repo submission.

### 💡 **Using Generative AI Responsibly**

You may use GenAI tools (such as ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) to assist in brainstorming or coding **only if** you stay guided and transparent.

If you do, you must include the following context in your prompt (copy and edit as needed):

> “I am a student in a junior-year computer science full-stack web development class.  
> For this project, the professor wants us to write a JavaScript game rendered on an HTML `<canvas>` with an animation game loop.  
> We are not allowed to use any frameworks. It must be creative and playable.  
> The goal is to gain experience coding in JavaScript on something fun.  
> Help me get started developing **[your idea here]**.”

Use GenAI like a **tutor**, not a **shortcut**.  
When you ask, focus on *understanding* and *exploration*:

- **Ask to learn:** “Explain each step of building a canvas game loop.”  
- **Fix by thinking:** “What does this error mean and how do I find it?”  
- **Iterate:** “Help me add collisions after I get one sprite moving.”  
- **Review:** “Check my code for clarity or better structure.”

> Keep it simple: *Learn first, copy last.*

Include the full prompt (or a summary of it) and a brief note about how you used the AI tool in your write-up.

### 🚫 **Banned Games**

These examples are considered **too simple** or **tutorial-level**, and will receive deductions for creativity if submitted:

- Pong / Breakout / Flappy Bird / Snake
- Tic-Tac-Toe / Memory Match / Hangman
- Whack-a-Mole / Bubble Pop / Accuracy-Clicker / Target-Trainer
- Rock-Paper-Scissors / Guess-the-Number / Slot Machine
- Simon Says / Single-Button Runner
- Any “Catch the Falling Object” or “Pop the Thing” style reflex game

---

### ✅ **Minimum Design Requirement**

Your game should include **at least one** of the following:
- Multiple levels or difficulty progression  
- A scoring or health system that updates dynamically  
- At least **two distinct gameplay states** beyond “start” and “game over”

This ensures every project demonstrates a small but meaningful level of interaction, logic, and game structure.

> Some starter code is provided in public/example.html but you are not required to use it.
